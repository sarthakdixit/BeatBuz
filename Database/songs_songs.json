they're your heart\r\nAnd you know you are their armor\r\nAnd you will destroy anyone who would try to harm her\r\nBut what happens when karma\r\nTurns right around and bites you\r\nAnd everything you stand for turns on you to spite you\r\nWhat happens when you become the main source of her pain\r\n\"Daddy look what I made\"\r\n\"Dad's gotta go catch a plane\"\r\n\"Daddy where's mommy?\r\nI can't find mommy, where is she?\"\r\n\"I don't know, go play, Hailie baby, your daddy's busy\r\nDaddy's writing a song, this song ain't gon' write itself\"\r\nI give you one underdog, and you gotta swing by yourself\r\nThen turn right around in that song and tell her you love her\r\nAnd put hands on her mother who's the spittin' image of her\r\nThat's Slim Shady, yeah baby Slim Shady's crazy\r\nShady made me\r\nBut tonight, Shady's rock-a-bye baby\r\n\r\nAnd when I'm gone just carry on don't mourn\r\nRejoice every time you hear the sound of my voice, just know that\r\nI'm lookin' down on you smilin'\r\nAnd I didn't feel a thing so baby, don't feel no pain, just smile back\r\n\r\nAnd when I'm gone just carry on don't mourn\r\nRejoice every time you hear the sound of my voice, just know that\r\nI'm lookin' down on you smilin'\r\nAnd I didn't feel a thing so baby, don't feel no pain, just smile back\r\n\r\nI keep havin' this dream\r\nI'm pushin' Hailie on a swing, she keeps screamin', she don't want me to sing\r\n\"You're makin' mommy cry, why, why is mommy cryin'\"\r\n\"Baby, daddy ain't leavin' no more, daddy you're lyin'\r\nYou always say that, you always say this is the last time\r\nBut you ain't leavin' no more daddy, you're mine\"\r\nShe's pilin' boxes in front of the door tryin' to block it\r\n\"Daddy please, daddy, don't leave, daddy, no, stop it\"\r\nGoes in her pocket, pulls out a tiny necklace locket\r\nIt's got a picture, \"This will keep you safe daddy, take it with ya\"\r\nI look up, it's just me standin' in the mirror\r\nThese fuckin' walls must be talkin', 'cause man I can hear 'em\r\nThey're sayin', \"you got one more chance to do right\r\nAnd it's tonight, now go out and show 'em that you love 'em before it's too late\"\r\nAnd just as I go to walk out of my bedroom door\r\nIt turns to a stage, they're gone and the spotlight is on and I'm singin'\r\n\r\nAnd when I'm gone just carry on don't mourn\r\nRejoice every time you hear the sound of my voice, just know that\r\nI'm lookin' down on you smilin'\r\nAnd I didn't feel a thing so baby, don't feel no pain, just smile back\r\n\r\nAnd when I'm gone just carry on don't mourn\r\nRejoice every time you hear the sound of my voice, just know that\r\nI'm lookin' down on you smilin'\r\nAnd I didn't feel a thing so baby, don't feel no pain, just smile back\r\n\r\nSixty thousand people all jumpin' out their seat\r\nThe curtain closes, they're throwin' roses at my feet\r\nI take a bow, and thank you all for comin' out\r\nThey're screamin' so loud, I take one last look at the crowd\r\nI glance down, I don't believe what I'm seein'\r\n\"Daddy, its me, help mommy, her wrists are bleedin'\"\r\nBut baby we're in Sweden\r\nHow did you get to Sweden?\r\n\"I followed you daddy\r\nYou told me that you weren't leavin'\r\nYou lied to me dad, and now you made mommy sad\r\nAnd I bought you this coin, it says number one dad\r\nThat's all I wanted, I just want to give you this coin\"\r\n\"I get the point, fine, me and mommy are goin'\"\r\n\"But baby wait, it's too late dad, you made your choice\r\nNow go out there and show 'em that you love 'em more than us\r\nThat's what they want\r\nThey want you, Marshall\r\nThey keep screamin' your name\r\nIt's no wonder you can't go to sleep\r\nJust take another pill, yeah I bet you you will!\r\nYou rap about it, yeah word, kid keep it real\"\r\nI hear a applause, all this time I couldn't see\r\nHow could it be, that the curtain is closin' on me\r\nI turn around, find a gun on the ground\r\nCock it, put it to my brain, scream \"die Shady!\" And pop it\r\nThe sky darkens, my life flashes\r\nThe plane that I was supposed to be on, crashes, and burns to ashes\r\nThat's when I wake up\r\nAlarm clock's ringing, there's birds singin'\r\nIt's spring and Hailie's outside swingin'\r\nI walk right up to Kim and kiss her tell her I miss her\r\nHailie just smiles and winks at her little sister almost as if to say\r\n\r\nAnd when I'm gone just carry on don't mourn\r\nRejoice every time you hear the sound of my voice, just know that\r\nI'm lookin' down on you smilin'\r\nAnd I didn't feel a thing so baby, don't feel no pain, just smile back\r\n\r\nAnd when I'm gone just carry on don't mourn\r\nRejoice every time you hear the sound of my voice, just know that\r\nI'm lookin' down on you smilin'\r\nAnd I didn't feel a thing so baby, don't feel no pain, just smile back",
